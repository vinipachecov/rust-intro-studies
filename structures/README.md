Structures

Structures are similar to tuples

Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be different types.

Unlike with tuples, you'll name each piece of data so it's clear what the values mean.

As a result of these names, struucts are more flexible than tuples.

To define a structure, we have to use the keyword struct:

```rs
struct User {

}
// Struct uses CamelCase
```
