Tuples

- it is a compound datatype
- it can store different types of values
- tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

syntax:
```rs
let tup = (326,4.9,22) 
let tup2: (i32,f64,u8) = (326,4.9,22)
```

* When you assign tuple to a variable then it is known as destructuring.
* Tuple index starts from 0.
